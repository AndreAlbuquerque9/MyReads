# MyReads Project

This is a project made for the first module of the Udacity React Developer course. In this project you can see three shelves of books with the names of "Currently reading", "Want to read" and "Read". You can also look for new books and add them to the shelves.

This project was forked from [udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

## Installation

* clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/AndreAlbuquerque9/MyReads.git`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Libraries

In this project I used the following libraries:

* [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
* [react-debounce-input](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-debounce-input)

## Back-end

The back-end server, the file `BooksAPI.js`, was given by the Udacity to simplify the development process.
